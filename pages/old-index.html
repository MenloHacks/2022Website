Thank you for your interest in participating in this year’s iteration of our event. We hope this message finds you well and staying healthy and safe. <br><br>

We’re here to inform you that we are shifting MenloHacks VI to an in-person event this fall. As COVID-19 cases have risen and fallen in the Bay Area, largely driven by the Delta and most recent Omicron variant, it’s been difficult to navigate the best format for our hackathon. In the past few weeks, we’ve received overwhelming feedback from students about the viability of a virtual event—simply put, with hope on the horizon for the COVID-19 pandemic, less and less of our target audience are interested in virtual events. <br><br>

Although we were ready to host the virtual event this weekend, our team ultimately made the decision to transition back to an in-person event, a few months later than the original date. We recognize that this news may disappoint some of you, and if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out. This decision was not made lightly, and we appreciate your patience as we prepare to offer an even better experience this fall. <br><br>

We hope that you will be able to join us this fall, but we understand that it may no longer be possible. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.
Please stay tuned for further updates; we look forward to seeing you in person in a few short months.<br><br>



Best,<br>

The MenloHacks Team</p>
